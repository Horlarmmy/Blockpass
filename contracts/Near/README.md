### Introduction

BlockPass is a decentralized platform built on the NEAR blockchain, designed to address the limitations of traditional event ticketing. By leveraging NFTs, BlockPass ensures fair ticket pricing, prevents scalping, and guarantees the authenticity of event tickets. Each event pass is minted as a unique NFT upon purchase, securing ownership and transparency.

### Installation

To set up and deploy BlockPass on the NEAR blockchain, follow these steps:

1. Clone the BlockPass repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Horlarmmy/Blockpass
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd Blockpass
   yarn install
   ```

3. Build the smart contract using the NEAR Rust SDK:

   ```bash
   cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
   ```

4. Deploy the contract to your NEAR testnet account:
   ```bash
   near deploy --accountId your-account.testnet --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/blockpass.wasm
   ```

### Usage

To create a new event pass, organizers can follow these steps:

1. Connect your NEAR wallet to the BlockPass platform.
2. Navigate to the "Create New Pass" section on the front-end interface.
3. Fill in the details for the pass, including the maximum pass count, start and end times for sales, the initial pass price, metadata, and category.
4. Confirm the pass creation, and it will be recorded on the NEAR blockchain.
