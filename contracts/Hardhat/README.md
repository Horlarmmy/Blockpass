### Introduction
BlockPass is a decentralized platform built on the Aurora blockchain, designed to address the limitations of traditional event ticketing. By leveraging NFTs, BlockPass ensures fair ticket pricing, prevents scalping, and guarantees the authenticity of event tickets. Each event pass is minted as a unique NFT upon purchase, securing ownership and transparency.
